1. Changed settling routine to verify based on slope of a fitted line for each 10k samples of a given channel being less than 0.001
AND
1a. Average (mean) counts of a given channel being within 10000 counts of ideal mean 

2. Added command line options for specifying AFG and DMM IP# and ports
2a. Added command line switch to print log INFO messages to console

3. A variety of QOL updates to messages sent to OPI

4. Added two multi-use columns for each channel on the OPI to report status during calibration, and final slope/intercept
