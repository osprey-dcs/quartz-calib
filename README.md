This initial version was done on location as a proof-of-concept and design prompt to nail down specifics.

It is currently invoked from the command line with two arguments - the first being the chassis number (two digits), and the second a "y" or "n" (yes/no) to tell the tool if it should push the calibration data directly to the PVs.

In it's current incarnation, I started it after activating the virtual environment on the 83.100 server located at /opt/venv (">source /opt/venv/bin/activate")
